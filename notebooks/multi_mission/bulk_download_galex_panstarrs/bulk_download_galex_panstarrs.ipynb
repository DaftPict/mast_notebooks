    "# **MAST Data Bulk Download through AWS**\n",
    "This notebook seeks to enhance the **Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes** (**MAST**) user experience for astronomers and scientists such that they can download mission specific data seamlessly! This notebook will help any astronomers with downloading data from two specific missions: `GALEX` and `Pan-STARRS (PS1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give some more context:\n",
    "* [Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/galex) was a space telescope managed primarily by JPL/CalTech that was launched in 2003. GALEX was launched on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (defunct) Pegasus launch vehicle, which one can view at the Smithsonian in Sterling, VA. It operated in the ultraviolet wavelength and was used to study galaxys' star formation from the early universe to the present. GALEX was decommissioned in 2013 and it's data is archived at MAST.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/) is located at Haleakala Oberservatory in Hawaii, US that surveys the sky for moving objects. Pan-STARRS was originally a collaboration between various academic institutions and the U.S. Air Force, given that the work has both scientific and defense/national security implications. The first Pan-STARRS telescope (PS1) has two data releases: DR1 and DR2 that we host here at MAST. DR2 is considered one of the largest astronomical datasets ever."

    "# Learning Goals\n",
    "By using this notebook, an astronomer or scientist will:\n",
    "* Understand that downloading data and files in bulk from AWS is feasible and possibly easier than going through the MAST portal.\n",
    "* Make targeted queries to MAST using parameters such as: `right ascension`, `declination`, `observation` and more.\n",
    "* Filter the resulting products by using parameters such as: `productType`, `productSubGroupDescription`, `productGroupDescription`, `mrp_only`, and more.\n",
    "* Use this notebook to programmatically download *.fits* files locally to their computer. Once the *.fits* files are downloaded, the researcher can experiment, prototype, etc. much easier."
